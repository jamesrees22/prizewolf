## ‚úÖ Done
- Dynamic site/adapters loaded from Supabase (`sites`, `adapter_rules`)
- Added RevComps-specific totals parsing (SOLD/REMAINING)
- Added Dream Car Giveaways (generic rules-driven)

- Odds now generated as "1 in N remaining"

---

## üöß Now (in progress / near term)
- [ ] UI: Show **Remaining tickets** column in results table

- [ ] Add more site adapters (e.g. 7Days Performance, Elite Competitions)
- [ ] Clean up error handling/logging in scraper route

---

## ‚è≠ Next (planned)
- [ ] User accounts: gate sites by **free vs premium tier**
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle / theme switcher in UI
- [ ] Build `/api/debug-sites` for quick Supabase connectivity tests
- [ ] Public roadmap page: show features + allow votes (powered by Supabase table)

---

## üåÄ Later (nice-to-haves / stretch goals)
- [ ] Mobile app wrapper (React Native / Expo)
- [ ] Browser extension for quick odds lookup
- [ ] Notification system (email or push) when new comps match saved searches
- [ ] Affiliate/commission tracking for outbound clicks

### Notes
- Keep schema migrations in `/supabase/sql`.
